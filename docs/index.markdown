# What is this?
This is a kind of "private" wiki, where I want to document various topics I have found interesting throughout the years.
The goal is to document whole [projects](./projects/index.md) as well as smaller [guides](./guides/index.md) on how to solve smaller problems in a project.
There are already many undocumented projects, but hopefully I will get to those at some point, for now I will focus on my latest projects.

# Tech stack
The usual suspects when I start a new project are the following technologies

* [React](https://react.dev/) for frontend using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for nice looking components.
* .Net 6 and C# for backend (usually an API using OpenAPI)
* PostgreSQL with Entity Framework as the database
